# PROGRESS — Praetoria Servicios

> Living state. Read this FIRST in every session. Keep current and compact.

## Project card
- Name / one-line purpose: Praetoria Servicios — mobile-first Spanish web app that turns a home problem explained with photos and plain language into a clear technical request, reviewed by AI and managed by an admin.
- Project type: web-app (Next.js full-stack) / secondary: none
- Stack & target platform(s): Next.js 16 (App Router) + React 19 + TypeScript strict + Tailwind v4; PostgreSQL + Prisma; Zod; decoupled adapters for AI / storage / email / WhatsApp / OCR. Target: modern browsers, mobile-first (320px+). See docs/03-technical-plan.md.
- License: UNLICENSED (private, proprietary) — see D-003
- Docs language: English (token economy). Product UI language: Spanish (es-ES).
- Security profile: references/security/web-app.md
- Accessibility: WCAG 2.2 AA floor (AAA where feasible), EN 301 549 / EAA (EU market) — references/accessibility.md
- i18n: single — product language Spanish (es-ES); copy centralised for future locales, not multi-language in v1 (D-006)
- Installed base: fresh v1
- Design system: founding — canonical, will live at src/ui/ + src/app/globals.css tokens (see issue #3)
- Keel portability: lock only (embedded skill copy not vendored — D-004)
- Assistant config: none (portability lock only)
- E2E: absent (will be added at issue #19 — `npm run test:e2e`, Playwright)
- CI runs on: main (default) — GitHub Actions on push to main, tags, and PRs to main
- Keel baseline: v5.19.0
- Website intent: no (the product IS the website; marketing landing is issue #4, in-app)
- Client budget: no
- User guide: deferred to Phase 6
- Docs theme: n/a until Phase 6
- Test-first policy: pure-logic (default) — state machine, money, Zod schemas, phone normalisation, AI-output validation get their tests written and seen failing before code. Asked-once default accepted (D-007).
- Durability: git remote origin https://github.com/FarinosV44/praetoria-servicios.git
- Autonomy: automatic — Keel does every merge to develop and every push itself / issues: after-sprint / Issue sweep interval: 24h / Issue capture: on
- Branches: integration branch `develop` (created from main at session 1) / current work branch: develop / nothing awaiting merge to main yet
- Notify: none (user chose chat-only) — a block is visible only on the next chat open
- Chaining: off (user chose "MVP core first"; no chained-chat launch — hand-off file written at every sprint close)
- Chaining model: n/a
- Chain verified: n/a

## Phase status
| Phase | Status | Key artifacts |
|-------|--------|---------------|
| 1 Discovery | done (condensed — the 27 issues + EPIC are the discovery input) | docs/01-discovery.md, docs/issues.md |
| 2 Functional spec | done (condensed) | docs/02-functional-spec.md, docs/03-technical-plan.md |
| 3 Design handoff | deferred — founding design system built inline per issue #3 (D-005); no external Design tool in this engagement | — |
| 4 Faithful build | n/a (no external design handoff) | — |
| 5 Development | in progress | docs/sprints/, docs/05-test-points.md |
| 6 Documentation | pending | docs/architecture.md, docs/api/ |
| 7 Release | pending | docs/07-release.md |
| 8 Website | n/a | — |

## Current position
- Phase: 5 — Development.  Sprint: 1 (issue #2) CLOSED and fully verified (TP-3 passed, session 2). #2 commented (beat 1), awaiting the user to close.
- Next action: Sprint 2 — issue #9 persistence layer: `RequestService` (`src/domain/requests/service.ts`) + `src/server/actions/requests.ts` creating requests, applying state-machine-validated transitions and writing immutable `StatusEvent` rows in one transaction, on the committed Prisma schema. Integration tests against the docker `praetoria_test` DB (test-first for the transition-recording + draft-expiry decision logic). Then issue #3 completion (Modal, Uploader, icons, mascot) → issue #6 (photos).

## Open items
- Unresolved user questions: none blocking. Anthropic API key + real provider keys will be needed before real-provider verification (all adapters have mock/dev impls so the MVP is not blocked — see D-008).
- Open Design Requests: none
- Unverified external steps/assets: real AI/storage/email providers not yet configured (dev adapters in use — MVP not blocked)
- Forge issues in progress: see docs/issues.md — all 27 open; building in dependency order

### Deferred items (consciously postponed work)
- Issues #20–#27 (professional intake, verified network, post-service/warranty, editorial CMS, SEO architecture, reviews, SEO control centre) — severity: growth features — review trigger: after issues #1–#19 complete (user decision, this session)
- Audio input in the assistant (issue #5) — UI prepared, capture not implemented — before release / when touching the assistant
- WhatsApp real provider API (issue #13) — link-generation MVP only — when a provider is chosen

Last updated: 2026-08-29 — Phase 5, Sprint 1 fully verified; starting Sprint 2 (issue #9)
